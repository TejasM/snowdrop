== Introduction

=== Package Structure

The Snowdrop distribution contains two types of artifacts:

Utility archives::  Libraries that contain utility classes and can be packaged in applications 

Server-side components::  Pre-packaged components that can be installed in the application server as deployers (JBoss AS5, JBoss AS6) or subsystems (JBoss AS7). 

The server-side components may include some of the utility libraries, where they are needed by the deployer or, respectively, subsystem.

Snowdrop provides the following utility libraries:

_snowdrop-vfs.jar_::  A library that contains the support classes for resource scanning (scanning the classpath for bean definitions, or using "classpath*:"-style patterns). 

_snowdrop-weaving.jar_::  A library that contains the support classes for load-time weaving. 

_snowdrop-deployers.jar_::  Contains utility classes used internally by the Spring deployer. It is not intended for direct use by developers. 

_snowdrop-namespace.jar_::  Custom namespace for easier configuration of beans that need access to JBoss internals (JMX server locator, JCA activation spec and resource adapter for JMS endpoints) 

Snowdrop provides the following pre-packaged deployers and subsystems:

_jboss-spring-deployer-as5.zip_::  This is a packaged distribution of the Spring deployer for JBoss AS5, which bootstraps and registers the application contexts to be used by your Java EE applications. 

_jboss-spring-deployer-as6.zip_::  This is a packaged distribution of the Spring deployer for JBoss AS6, which bootstraps and registers the application contexts to be used by your Java EE applications. 

_jboss-spring-subsystem-as7.zip_::  This is a packaged distribution of the Spring subsystem for JBoss AS7, which bootstraps and registers the application contexts to be used by your Java EE applications.
