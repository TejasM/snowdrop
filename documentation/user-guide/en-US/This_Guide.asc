== What This Guide Covers

Snowdrop is a utility package that contains JBoss-specific extensions to the Spring Framework. These extensions are either: 


* extensions to Spring Framework classes that can be used wherever the generic implementations provided by the framework do not integrate correctly with JBoss AS. 


* extensions for deploying and running Spring applications with  JBoss AS. 

This user guide aims to cover the functionality of Snowdrop, to describe its components, and to provide information on how to use it optimally for running Spring applications in JBoss AS.

Later Spring versions (3.1, 3.2. etc.) may be compatible with Snowdrop 2.0 as long as they maintain binary compatibility with Spring 3.0. In such cases, the instructions regarding Spring 3.0 apply to Spring 3.1 and later as well.
